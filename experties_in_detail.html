                <div>I am a scholarship student at Mahidol University's Faculty of Information and Communication Technology who is also interested in self-improvement, entrepreneurship and psychology. I specialize in graphic design, branding, user interface design, and personal advising and I have several strong, soft skills such as empathy, lifelong learning, adaptability, leadership and others.
                    <br><br>
                    I increased page engagement during the launch of my project and again when my graphic design was published. I also have experience with programming (C, Java, SQL, HTML-CSS-JS, Python), database management, and project management. In addition, I am a communication expert with experience in public speaking on small and large segments, and story writing.
